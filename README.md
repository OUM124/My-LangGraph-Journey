# 🧠 My LangGraph Journey

Welcome to my personal learning repository on **LangGraph**, a powerful framework built on top of LangChain for building **stateful, multi-agent applications** using graphs. This project tracks my hands-on progress as I experiment with building intelligent agents and workflows powered by local LLMs such as **Ollama**.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `FirstSteps/`  
  Initial experiments with LangGraph fundamentals: state definition, single-node graphs, and synchronous chains.

- `AIAgents/`  
  Advanced use cases with multiple agents, memory persistence, and interaction with local models via **OllamaLLM**.

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10+**
- **LangGraph**
- **LangChain**
- **Ollama** (for local LLM inference)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for step-by-step development)
- **GitHub** (for version control and documentation)

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Understand and implement LangGraph nodes, edges, and states
- Create autonomous and reactive AI agents
- Integrate with local LLMs like `llama3` using Ollama
- Document all learnings and experiments

---

## 🔧 How to Run

> Make sure [Ollama](https://ollama.com) is installed and running on `localhost:11434` before running the notebooks.

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OUM124/My-LangGraph-Journey.git
